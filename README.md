# Rogue-Tower-Respec
A MelonLoader mod for Rogue Tower that changes the "Reset XP" button to "Respec XP", which does what you'd expect it to.

### Note
This mod is for the initial release of Rogue Tower. To check whether the mod is running, make sure the button says "Respec XP", and no confirmation window pops up when you click it.

### Instructions
1. Download MelonLoader.Installer.exe from https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases/latest
2. Run the installer and point it to your Rogue Tower.exe (you can find this in Steam by right-clicking the game in your library and going to Manage -> Browse local files)
3. Download Respec.dll from https://github.com/Jdewi12/Rogue-Tower-Respec/releases and drop it in the Mods folder that was created next to your Rogue Tower.exe
