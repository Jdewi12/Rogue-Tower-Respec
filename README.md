# Rogue-Tower-Respec
A BepInEx mod for Rogue Tower that changes the "Reset XP" button to "Respec XP", which does what you'd expect it to.

### Note
This mod could break in future updates. To check whether the mod is running, make sure the button says "Respec XP", and no confirmation window pops up when you click it.

### Instructions
1. Install BepInEx (https://rogue-tower.thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInEx_Rogue_Tower/)
2. Put Respec.dll in `Rogue TowerBepInEx/plugins`
